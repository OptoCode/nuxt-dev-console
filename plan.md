# Plan

## DevConsole Component Improvements:
1. Log Filtering Enhancements:
Add the ability to filter logs by custom tags or categories
Implement a search history feature to quickly access previous searches
2. Performance Optimizations:
Implement virtualized scrolling for better performance with large log volumes
Add log batching to prevent UI freezes when many logs occur rapidly
3. UI/UX Improvements:
Add a dark/light theme toggle that respects system preferences
Implement collapsible log groups for better organization
Add the ability to save logs to a file for later analysis
4. Integration Improvements:
Add network request logging capabilities
Implement a visual representation of component lifecycle events

## dev-logger.js Plugin Improvements:
1. Enhanced API:
Add support for custom log categories/tags: $devLogger.logWithTag('api', 'API request successful')
Implement log levels with filtering: $devLogger.setLevel('warn') to only show warnings and errors
2. Performance Features:
Add sampling capability for high-volume logs: $devLogger.sample('frequent-event', 0.1) to only log 10% of events
Implement conditional logging: $devLogger.logIf(condition, 'message')
3. Developer Experience:
Add TypeScript type definitions for better IDE support
Implement method chaining for more expressive logging: $devLogger.withContext('auth').info('User logged in')
4. Integration Improvements:
Add Pinia/Vuex state tracking capabilities
Implement router navigation logging
